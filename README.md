# SQL Projects
A collection of projects I've completed using SQL commands and queries

## Online Sports Retail Revenue
This analytics project uses 5 tables in a fictional online sportswear store database. The project is an exploration of product data, website activity, and historical revenue to develop recommendations for revenue growth. The database, sports, contains 5 tables; info, finance, reviews, traffic, and brand, with product_id being the primary key for every table. The project goes through a demonstration of skills such as joining tables, filtering and grouping results, case statements, nested queries, aggregate functions, common table expressions, and other functions for data manipulation. 

Analysis of the data helped develop the following recommendations:
1. Decrease Adidas discounts for potential increased revenue
2. Increase Nike discounts for potential increased revenue
3. Offer a small discount in exchance for leaving a product review, to be used on the next customer purchase, during quarters 2-4

## Analyzing High-growth/"Unicorn" Companies 2019-2021
This project takes the perspective of an investment firm looking to understand which industries are seeing the most growth and to identify any new companies that could help the firm capitalize on their investments. Companies who have reached a valuation of $1b, also known as "unicorns", are gathered in this database. The database of unicorn companies to analyze has 4 tables; dates, funding, industries, and companies. The project uses common table expressions and other SQL commands to identify the companies who became unicorns in the years 2019-2021. The analysis found that the top performing industry was Fintech, with 138 companies reaching at least $1b in revenue in 2021, and an average valuation of $2.75b. The recommendation for the investment firm is to invest in Fintech companies, who have seen the most growth in the selected years. The other notable industries, Internet and Software Services and Ecommerce & Direct-to-Consumer, are also seeing substantial growth. Diversifying investments amongst these three tech industries could be beneficial for their portolio development. 

## Motorcycle Part Sales Analysis
This project seeks to understand the revenue streams of a company that sells motorcycle parts. There are three warehouses in the database and they serve both retail and wholesale customers. In the scenario, the board of directors for the company want to better understand wholesale revenue by product line and provided a table from their database, called 'sales'.
