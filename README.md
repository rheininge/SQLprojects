This analytics project uses 5 tables in a fictional online sportswear store. The project is an exploration of product data, website traffic, and historical revenue to develop recommendations for revenue growth, presented to a sales or marketing team. The database, sports, contains 5 tables; info, finance, reviews, traffic, and brand, with product_id being the primary key for every table.
