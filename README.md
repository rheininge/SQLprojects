# SQLprojects
A collection of projects I've completed using SQL commands and queries

## Online Sports Retail Revenue
This analytics project uses 5 tables in a fictional online sportswear store database. The project is an exploration of product data, website activity, and historical revenue to develop recommendations for revenue growth. The database, sports, contains 5 tables; info, finance, reviews, traffic, and brand, with product_id being the primary key for every table. The project goes through a demonstration of skills such as joining tables, filtering and grouping results, case statements, nested queries, aggregate functions, common table expressions, and other functions for data manipulation. 

Analysis of the data helped develop the following recommendations:
1. Decrease Adidas discounts for potential increased revenue
2. Increase Nike discounts for potential increased revenue
3. Offer a small discount in exchance for leaving a product review, to be used on the next customer purchase, during quarters 2-4
